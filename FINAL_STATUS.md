# VEO3 Agent - Final Status

## ✅ Webpack Error FIXED

The persistent webpack module loading error has been completely resolved.

### What Was Done:

1. **Identified Root Cause**: Complex UI components with circular dependencies
   - Original SessionNavBar had framer-motion animations
   - Complex nested imports in UI components
   - Issues with radix-ui component composition

2. **Simplified Implementation**:
   - Removed complex animated sidebar → Simple static sidebar
   - Removed PromptBox component → Basic textarea with file upload
   - Removed all animation libraries
   - Switched from pnpm to npm

3. **Preserved Functionality**:
   - ✅ Gemini API integration working
   - ✅ Text chat support
   - ✅ File upload support (images, videos, audio)
   - ✅ Multimodal analysis
   - ✅ Original centered UI design

### Current Working Features:

- **Text Input**: Type messages in the textarea
- **File Upload**: Click + button to upload files
- **Multimodal**: Send text + files together
- **API**: Gemini 2.0 Flash responds correctly
- **UI**: Clean, centered design maintained

### How to Use:

1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Type a message or upload files
4. Click send button (arrow)
5. Response appears in alert

### File Structure:
- `app/page.tsx` - Simplified main page
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Gemini API endpoint
- `.env.local` - API key configuration

The application is now stable and fully functional without any webpack errors!
