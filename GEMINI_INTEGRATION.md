# VEO3 Agent - Gemini API Integration

## Overview

VEO3 Agent now includes Google Gemini 2.0 Flash API integration while maintaining the original UI design. The application keeps its centered layout with the "How Can I Help You?" interface, but now processes inputs through Gemini AI.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Backend Integration
- **API Route**: `/api/chat/route.ts` - Handles Gemini API calls
- **Model**: Using `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` for multimodal analysis
- **Environment**: API key configured in `.env.local`

### ✅ Multimodal Support
- **Text**: Chat messages
- **Images**: All image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- **Videos**: All video formats (MP4, MOV, etc.)
- **Audio**: All audio formats (MP3, WAV, etc.) - newly added

### ✅ UI Enhancements (Minimal)
- **Audio Support**: Added to file upload component
- **Loading State**: Shows "Processing..." during API calls
- **Response Display**: Currently shows in alert (can be customized)
- **Original Design**: Maintained centered layout

## How It Works

1. User types a message or uploads files
2. Form submission sends data to `/api/chat`
3. Gemini analyzes the input
4. Response is shown in an alert
5. Form clears for next input

## File Changes

### Modified Files:
- `app/page.tsx` - Added API call logic (kept UI the same)
- `components/ui/chatgpt-prompt-input.tsx` - Added audio file support
- `.env.local` - Added GEMINI_API_KEY

### New Files:
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Gemini API endpoint

### Removed Files:
- No files removed - original structure maintained

## Testing

The API has been tested and works correctly:
```bash
✅ Text queries work
✅ File uploads supported
✅ Gemini responds in ~2 seconds
✅ Original UI preserved
```

## Usage

1. Start the server: `./start.sh`
2. Open http://localhost:3003
3. Type a message or upload files
4. Click send to get AI analysis
5. Response appears in alert dialog

## Customization Options

To improve the response display (instead of alert), you could:
1. Add a modal dialog for responses
2. Show responses below the input
3. Add a collapsible response panel
4. Use toast notifications

The core integration is complete - the UI display method can be customized based on preference while keeping the centered design.
