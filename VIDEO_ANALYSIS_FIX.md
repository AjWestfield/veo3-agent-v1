# Video Analysis Fix - Implementation Guide

## Problem Fixed
The video file was uploading but not being analyzed because the implementation was trying to send large video files as inline data, which doesn't work properly for video analysis with the Gemini API.

## Solution Implemented
Updated the chat API route to use the **Google AI File Manager** for video uploads, which is the recommended approach for video files, especially larger ones.

### Key Changes:

1. **Added File Manager Import**
   ```typescript
   import { GoogleAIFileManager } from "@google/generative-ai/server"
   const fileManager = new GoogleAIFileManager(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY || "")
   ```

2. **Video Upload Process**
   - Videos are now uploaded to Google's File API first
   - The system waits for the video to be processed
   - Once processed, the file URI is sent to Gemini for analysis

3. **File Handling Logic**
   - **Images**: Continue to use inline data (base64) for files under 20MB
   - **Videos**: Always use File API upload for better reliability
   - **Audio**: Use inline data for files under 20MB

## How It Works

1. When you upload a video file:
   - The file is first uploaded to Google's File API
   - The system monitors the processing status
   - Once ready, the file URI is passed to Gemini for analysis

2. Processing Flow:
   ```
   User uploads video → File API Upload → Wait for Processing → Send URI to Gemini → Get Analysis
   ```

## Benefits

- **Handles Large Files**: Supports videos up to 1GB
- **Better Reliability**: Videos are processed more reliably
- **Faster Analysis**: Pre-processed videos analyze faster
- **Progress Tracking**: Can monitor upload and processing status

## Testing Your Video

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open http://localhost:3003

3. Upload your video file (up to 1GB)

4. The system will:
   - Show "Processing..." while uploading
   - Upload to Google's servers
   - Wait for processing to complete
   - Analyze the video content
   - Return the analysis results

## Video Analysis Capabilities

With Gemini 2.0 Flash, you can:
- Get video summaries
- Extract key moments with timestamps
- Analyze visual content frame by frame
- Transcribe speech from the video
- Answer questions about the video content
- Identify objects, people, and activities

## Example Prompts for Video Analysis

- "Summarize this video"
- "What happens at the 2-minute mark?"
- "List all the key moments with timestamps"
- "What objects appear in this video?"
- "Transcribe any speech in the video"
- "Describe the main activities shown"

## Technical Details

- **Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental
- **Video Formats**: MP4, AVI, MOV, and other common formats
- **Max Size**: 1GB per video
- **Processing**: ~1 FPS sampling, 1Kbps audio
- **Context**: Can process videos up to 2 hours at standard resolution

The video analysis is now fully functional and ready to use!
