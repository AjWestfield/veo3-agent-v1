## Sidebar Implementation Fixed

I've successfully restored the full sidebar functionality to your veo3-agent chat application.

### What was fixed:
1. **Imported the proper sidebar component** - Changed from a simple colored strip to the full-featured `SessionNavBar` component
2. **Added proper margin** - Added `ml-[3.05rem]` to the main content area to account for the collapsed sidebar width

### Sidebar Features:
- **Collapsible/Expandable** - Hover over the sidebar to expand it
- **New Chat Button** - Create new chat sessions
- **Chat History Section** - View and manage previous chats
- **Media Sections** - Organize images, videos, and audio files
- **User Controls** - Account and Settings buttons at the bottom
- **Smooth Animations** - Powered by Framer Motion

### How to use:
1. Hover over the sidebar to expand it
2. Click "New Chat" to start a new conversation
3. Your chat history will be saved in the sidebar
4. Media files will be organized by type
5. Access account and settings from the bottom buttons

The sidebar is now fully functional and integrated with your streaming chat interface!
