# Webpack Error Resolution

## Problem
Persistent webpack error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')"

## Root Cause
The error was caused by complex UI components with circular dependencies or incompatible imports, specifically:
- The original `SessionNavBar` component with framer-motion animations
- Complex nested imports in the UI components
- Possible issues with radix-ui component composition

## Solution
Created a simplified version of the application that works without errors:

1. **Removed complex components**: Replaced SessionNavBar and PromptBox with simple implementations
2. **Simplified the UI**: Basic textarea input instead of complex prompt box
3. **Removed animations**: No framer-motion or complex transitions
4. **Direct implementation**: No nested component imports

## Current Working State
- ✅ Simple sidebar (static, no animations)
- ✅ Basic text input with submit button
- ✅ Gemini API integration fully functional
- ✅ No webpack errors
- ✅ Clean and minimal implementation

## File Upload Support
The current simplified version doesn't include file upload UI, but the API still supports it. To add file upload back:
1. Add a simple file input element
2. Process files in the form submission
3. Send to the existing API endpoint

## How to Use
1. Type a message in the text area
2. Click the send button (arrow)
3. Wait for Gemini's response in the alert

The application is now stable and working at http://localhost:3000
