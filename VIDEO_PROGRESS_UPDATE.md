# Video Upload Progress Tracking Implementation

## Summary of Improvements

I've successfully implemented real-time progress tracking for video uploads to address the issue where the UI appeared stuck during long video uploads. Here's what was improved:

### Backend Changes (app/api/chat/route.ts)

1. **Enabled SSE Streaming for Videos**
   - Removed the restriction that disabled streaming for video uploads
   - Now all requests with `Accept: text/event-stream` header use streaming

2. **Added Progress Events**
   - **Preparing stage**: "Preparing to process your video..."
   - **Upload stage**: "Uploading [filename] ([size]MB)..." and "Uploading to cloud..."
   - **Processing stage**: "Processing video... (Xs elapsed)" with real-time elapsed time updates
   - **Analyzing stage**: "Video ready. Analyzing content..."

3. **Event Types**
   - `type: 'progress'` - For progress updates
   - `type: 'content'` - For actual response content
   - `type: 'error'` - For error messages

### Frontend Changes (app/page.tsx)

1. **Dynamic Progress Messages**
   - Removed static "Processing your video upload..." message
   - Now displays real-time progress updates from the backend

2. **Visual Progress Indicators**
   - Added animated progress bar that shows:
     - 10% - Initial upload
     - 33% - Uploading to cloud
     - 66% - Processing video
     - 90% - Analyzing content
   - Shows elapsed time counter for processing stage
   - Smooth transitions between stages

3. **Improved Loading States**
   - Better loading animation with "Preparing response..." text
   - Proper handling of streaming vs non-streaming states

### Testing

Created `test-video-progress.sh` script for easy testing of video uploads with progress tracking.

## How It Works Now

1. User uploads a video file
2. Frontend immediately shows "Preparing to process your video..."
3. As upload progresses: "Uploading video.mp4 (327.1MB)..."
4. During cloud upload: "Uploading to cloud..." with progress bar at 33%
5. During processing: "Processing video... (12s elapsed)" with progress bar at 66%
6. When ready: "Video ready. Analyzing content..." with progress bar at 90%
7. Finally replaced with actual AI response content

## Benefits

- Users now see real-time progress instead of a frozen message
- Clear indication of current stage (upload vs processing vs analyzing)
- Visual progress bar provides intuitive feedback
- Elapsed time counter helps set expectations
- Much better user experience for large video uploads

The implementation successfully addresses the original issue where users would see a static message for 90+ seconds with no indication of progress.
