# VEO3 Agent - Gemini Integration (Corrected)

## ✅ What Was Done (Maintaining Original UI)

### 1. **Backend API Integration**
- Created `/api/chat/route.ts` for Gemini API calls
- Configured with your API key in `.env.local`
- Using `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model
- Supports text, images, videos, and audio

### 2. **Minimal Frontend Changes**
- **Original UI Preserved**: Kept centered "How Can I Help You?" layout
- **Form Logic Updated**: Now calls Gemini API instead of just showing alert
- **Audio Support Added**: File input now accepts audio files
- **Loading State**: Shows "Processing..." during API calls
- **Response Display**: Currently uses alert (as original did)

### 3. **What Was NOT Changed**
- ❌ No chat history interface
- ❌ No message bubbles
- ❌ No full-screen chat layout
- ✅ Kept original centered design
- ✅ Kept original form behavior

## How It Works Now

1. User sees the same centered interface
2. Types message or uploads files (now including audio)
3. Clicks send button
4. Backend sends to Gemini API
5. Response shown in alert dialog
6. Form clears for next input

## File Changes Summary

**Modified (Minimal)**:
- `app/page.tsx` - Added API call logic only
- `components/ui/chatgpt-prompt-input.tsx` - Added audio file support

**Created**:
- `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Gemini API endpoint
- `.env.local` - API key configuration

**Kept As-Is**:
- All UI components
- Overall layout and design
- Dark theme styling

## Testing Confirmed
✅ Original UI intact
✅ API integration working
✅ All file types supported

The integration is complete while preserving your original design exactly as requested.
