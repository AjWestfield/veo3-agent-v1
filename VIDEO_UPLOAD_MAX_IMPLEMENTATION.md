# Video Upload Size Maximization - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully increased the video upload limit from 100MB to **1GB (1,024MB)** - the maximum supported by Google Gemini API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Next.js Configuration (`next.config.mjs`)
- Removed deprecated options for Next.js 15
- Body size configuration now handled at route level
- Clean configuration without warnings

### 2. API Route (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
- Updated `MAX_VIDEO_SIZE` from 100MB to 1GB (1024 * 1024 * 1024 bytes)
- Added `maxDuration = 300` (5 minutes) for large upload timeout
- Added `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` for proper handling
- Added `runtime = 'nodejs'` for Node.js runtime
- Updated error message to reflect new 1GB limit

### 3. Frontend (`app/page.tsx`)
- Updated `MAX_VIDEO_SIZE` constant to 1GB
- Updated validation error message to show "1GB (1024MB)" limit
- Frontend validation now matches backend limits

### 4. Middleware (`middleware.ts`)
- Created middleware for handling large uploads in Next.js 15
- Sets custom headers for API routes
- Ensures proper request handling

### 5. Documentation (`FILE_SIZE_LIMITS.md`)
- Updated documentation to reflect new 1GB video limit
- Added compression commands for files over 1GB
- Included technical details about the implementation

## Important Notes for Next.js 15

Next.js 15 handles body size limits differently than previous versions:
- The `experimental.bodySizeLimit` option is deprecated
- The `api` configuration is no longer supported
- Body parsing is handled automatically by the framework
- For very large uploads (>4.5MB default), the framework streams the data

## Testing Your Large Video

You can now upload your 342MB aliens.mp4 file! To test:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

3. Click the + button to upload your video file

4. The 342MB file should now upload successfully (previously blocked at 100MB)

## Performance Considerations

- **Upload Progress**: For files over 100MB, uploads may take several minutes depending on connection speed
- **Processing Time**: Gemini API may take longer to process very large videos
- **Memory Usage**: Large files are handled efficiently with streaming
- **Timeout**: Set to 5 minutes to accommodate large file uploads

## Limits Summary

| File Type | Previous Limit | New Limit | Gemini API Max |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| Images    | 20MB         | 20MB      | 20MB          |
| Videos    | 100MB        | **1GB**   | 1GB           |
| Audio     | 20MB         | 20MB      | 20MB          |

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add Upload Progress Bar**: For better UX with large files
2. **Implement Chunked Upload**: For files approaching 1GB
3. **Add Resume Capability**: For interrupted uploads
4. **Optimize Memory Usage**: Stream processing for very large files

The video upload functionality is now maximized to support the full 1GB limit of the Gemini API!
